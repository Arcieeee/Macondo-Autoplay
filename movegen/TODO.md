- [x] generate all plays
    - [x] initial play must hit center square
    - [x] deduplicate
    - [ ] generate exchanges
- [x] score all generated plays and sort
- [ ] First major-ish refactor:
    - [ ] utilize the "lexicon" package and move tile drawing there
    - [ ] separate out the board into another package, maybe move cross-set and cross-scores there.
- allow for comp v comp games
    - cross-sets and cross-scores recalculated after every play
    - output to gcg
    - pick highest scoring move, log, create ultraleaves

- script with Lua?
