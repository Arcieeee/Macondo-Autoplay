# Manual

[Back to Main Page](/macondo)

## How do I use this?

First, follow the installation instructions in the [main page](/macondo).
Run the `macondo` executable.

The manual can be accessed within the executable by typing `help` while inside
Macondo. Each topic in the manual can be further explained with `help <topic>`.

These instructions are subject to change, and once we add a GUI, the usage
will be quite different.

Below we have some more specific manuals for various topics.

- [Autoplay](/macondo/manual/autoplay.html)
- [make_gaddag](/macondo/manual/make_gaddag.html)
- [make_leaves_structure](/macondo/manual/make_leaves_structure.html)
