## How to use other languages

NWL23 is currently the default lexicon of Macondo.

If you wish to use other lexica, you can just use `set lexicon OSPS42 polish` inside the Macondo shell, for example. The first argument is the lexicon name; the second argument is the letter distribution name.

Some other values for letter distribution: `spanish`, `polish`, `german`, `norwegian`, `french`, `catalan`, `polish`, `dutch`. There will be more in the future.

The letter distribution is optional. If not provided, Macondo will make a best guess of what to use based on the lexicon name.

You can find lexicon kwg files at [https://github.com/woogles-io/liwords/blob/master/liwords-ui/public/wasm](https://github.com/woogles-io/liwords/blob/master/liwords-ui/public/wasm)
