    "#### Background\n",
    "This notebook seeks to quantify the value of leaving a certain number of tiles in the bag during the pre-endgame based on a repository of games. We will then implement these values as a pre-endgame heuristic in the Macondo speedy player to improve simulation quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial questions:\n",
    "1. What is the probability that you will go out first if you make a play leaving N tiles in the bag?\n",
    "2. (slightly harder) What is the expected improvement in end-of-game spread after making a play that leaves N tiles in the bag?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation details\n",
    "We'll need to make several passes through the log file to obtain the following:\n",
    "* Final spread of each simulated game\n",
    "* Delta between pre-endgame and final spread\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "* We're only analyzing complete games\n",
    "* The last two rows in the log file for a given game ID are also the last two turns of the game\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next steps\n",
    "* Standardize sign convention for spread.\n",
    "* Start figuring out how to calculate pre-endgame spread"
