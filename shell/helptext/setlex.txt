set lexicon <lexicon> [distribution] - Set the lexicon and letter distribution

Example
    set lexicon CSW19
    set lexicon OSPS42 polish

The first example sets the lexicon to CSW19. The second example sets the
lexicon to OSPS42. Note the distribution argument in the second example.

Macondo will attempt to guess the letter distribution based on the lexicon
name. If you are using a non-standard lexicon name, you must specify
the letter distribution name as the second argument.

Acceptable letter distributions so far are:

    spanish
    french
    english
    polish
    german
    norwegian
    catalan

More will be added in the future.

Note that the ./data/lexica directory must contain a word-finding data
structure (usually a GADDAG) for the lexicon that you chose.

Your default lexicon and letter distribution will be saved to a local config file
for future use; you should typically only need to set the defaults once.

If Macondo can't find your lexicon in its data directory, it will attempt to download
it from the Woogles codebase. An error will be shown if it's unsuccessful.
