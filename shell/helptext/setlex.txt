setlex <lexicon> [distribution] - Set the lexicon and letter distribution

Example
    setlex CSW19
    setlex OSPS42 polish

The first example sets the lexicon to CSW19. The second example sets the
lexicon to OSPS42. Note the distribution argument in the second example.

The default letter distribution is `english`. So if you are using a non-English
tile distribution, you must specify its name as the second argument.

Acceptable letter distributions so far are:

    spanish
    english
    polish

More will be added in the future.

Note that the ./data/lexica directory must contain a word-finding data
structure (usually a GADDAG) for the lexicon that you chose.

To set your default lexicon and letter distribution permanently, please
set the following environment variables before running this program:

    DEFAULT_LEXICON
    DEFAULT_LETTER_DISTRIBUTION

For example: DEFAULT_LEXICON=CSW19 ./macondo
