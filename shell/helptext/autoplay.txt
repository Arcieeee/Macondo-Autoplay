autoplay [options] - computer vs computer games

Example:

    autoplay
    autoplay stop
    autoplay -file /path/to/log.txt
    autoplay exhaustiveleave noleave -file foo.txt


autoplay can be used to generate computer vs computer games for research
purposes.

To stop autoplay, type `autoplay stop`. If no log file is specified,
it will default to `/tmp/autoplay.txt`, otherwise, use the desired
filename as an option.

By default, autoplay will use two identical, fast AI players of type
'exhaustiveleave'. An 'exhaustiveleave' player uses values for all possible
leaves that must already be in the data/strategy directory. If you don't have
any values or wish to try with no values, you can use the 'noleave' player.

In the future, we will add other types of players.
