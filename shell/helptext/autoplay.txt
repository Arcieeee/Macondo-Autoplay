autoplay [options] - computer vs computer games

Example:

    autoplay 
    autoplay stop
    autoplay /path/to/log.txt


autoplay can be used to generate computer vs computer games for research
purposes.

To stop autoplay, type `autoplay stop`. If no log file is specified,
it will default to `/tmp/autoplay.txt`, otherwise, use the desired
filename as an option. If you wish to log to a file named `stop` then
you are a bad person and should feel bad.
