sim [plies] [options] - Start or stop a Monte Carlo simulation

Example:
    sim
    sim 2
    sim 3
    sim 3 3
    sim continue
    sim stop
    sim show
    sim details
    sim log
    sim trim 3

A list of plays must have been generated or added in another way already.

If the argument is a number, it is interpreted as a number of plies. Otherwise,
use `stop` to stop a running simulation, `show` to show the plays ranked
by equity so far, and `details` to see more per-ply details of each play.

Sim `continue` will continue a previously stopped simulation from where
it left off. You can `stop` a simulation, delete plays with the `trim`
command, and restart the simulation this way if you wish it to be faster.

Sim `trim` takes in a numerical argument: the number of plays to remove
from the BOTTOM of the sorted play list. So, for example, `sim trim 5` will
remove the bottom 5 plays. You may want to run this after simulating for
some number of iterations.

Adding a second number (as in sim 3 3 above) interprets the second number
as the number of threads to use for the simulation. This number defaults
to the greater or 1 or your number of CPUs minus 1.

Before starting a simulation, you can also do `sim log` to write the log
to a temporary file.
