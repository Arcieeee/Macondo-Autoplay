sim [args] [options] - Start or stop a Monte Carlo simulation

Example:
    sim
    sim -plies 3
    sim -plies 3 -stop 95
    sim -plies 3 -threads 3
    sim continue
    sim stop
    sim show
    sim details
    sim log
    sim trim 3

A list of plays must have been generated or added in another way already.

Optional arguments:

    Use `stop` to stop a running simulation, `show` to show the plays ranked
    by equity so far, and `details` to see more per-ply details of each play.

    Sim `continue` will continue a previously stopped simulation from where
    it left off. You can `stop` a simulation, delete plays with the `trim`
    command, and restart the simulation this way if you wish it to be faster.

    Sim `trim` takes in a numerical argument: the number of plays to remove
    from the BOTTOM of the sorted play list. So, for example, `sim trim 5` 
    will remove the bottom 5 plays. You may want to run this after simulating
    for some number of iterations.

    Before starting a simulation, you can also do `sim log` to write the log
    to a temporary file.


Options:

    -plies 3

    The above option will use 3 plies of look-ahead. By default, Macondo 
    uses 2 plies.

    -threads 3

    The above option sets the number of threads that Macondo uses to sim
    your game (3 in this example). If not set, this number defaults to 
    the greater or 1 or your number of CPUs minus 1.

    -stop 95

    You can use 95 or 99 for this option. This makes the sim stop when it is
    95 (or 99) percent sure that the top move is the winning move. 

    Note: using this option will stop the simulation after a fixed number of 
    plies (usually 5000). It's possible to get to 5000 plies without having
    a clear winner, but this usually means the winning plays are pretty similar.
