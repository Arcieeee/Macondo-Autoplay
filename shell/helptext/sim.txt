sim [plies] [options] - Start or stop a Monte Carlo simulation

Example:
    sim 2
    sim 3
    sim 3 3
    sim stop
    sim show
    sim details
    sim log

A list of plays must have been generated or added in another way already.

If the argument is a number, it is interpreted as a number of plies. Otherwise,
use `stop` to stop a running simulation, `show` to show the plays ranked
by equity so far, and `details` to see more per-ply details of each play.

Adding a second number (as in sim 3 3 above) interprets the second number
as the number of threads to use for the simulation. This number defaults
to the greater or 1 or your number of CPUs minus 1.

Before starting a simulation, you can also do `sim log` to write the log
to a temporary file.
