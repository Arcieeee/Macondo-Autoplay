add [params] - Add a play to the list of plays

Example:
   add 3J FOO
   add K5 BAR.D
   add exchange ABC
   add pass


The first two examples take in a set of coordinates and letters.
If the number is first, the play is horizontal, otherwise, it is vertical,
as in standard Crossword Game notation.

When specifying a play that goes through a letter already on the board,
you must specify a period (.) for the letter.

The third example adds an exchange of three tiles. Specify the blank as ?.
