add [params] - Add a play to the current board, and commit it.

Example:
   add #3
   add 3J FOO
   add K5 BAR.D
   add exchange ABC
   add pass

The first example, add #3, adds the play numbered "3" in the output of
a "gen" command.

The second and third example take in a set of coordinates and letters.
If the number is first, the play is horizontal, otherwise, it is vertical,
as in standard Crossword Game notation.

When specifying a play that goes through a letter already on the board,
you must specify a period (.) for the letter.

The fourth example adds an exchange of three tiles. Specify the blank as ?.

Note that adding a play to the board will immediately commit it and switch the current turn.
