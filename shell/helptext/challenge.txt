challenge [n] - challenge play

Example:

    challenge 5
    challenge

Challenge challenges the last play. There are various categories. By default,
Macondo's settings are set to double challenge, but this can easily be
overridden with the above options.

For example, `challenge 5` will add a 5-point bonus to the last play.
`challenge 0` can be used to simulate SINGLE challenge (adds a 0-point bonus)
Note that these two examples do _not_ check the validity of the word.

Typing just `challenge` by itself, though, actually checks the validity of the
word(s), and simulates double challenge.
If all words are valid, the challenging player loses their turn. If
any word is invalid, the opponent takes their tiles back and loses their turn.
