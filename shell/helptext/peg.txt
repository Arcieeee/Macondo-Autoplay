peg [options] - solve pre-endgame exhaustively

Example:

    peg -threads 1
    peg -threads 8 -endgameplies 6 -maxtime 10

About:
    Macondo can solve a 1-tile-in-the-bag pre-endgame exhaustively. It does this
    by solving all possible endgames using a fast search for it (see -first-win-optim
    option in the endgame).

    When considering `pass` as a move, Macondo will try all options exhaustively
    for our opponent. Our opponent may make a "mistake" from their perspective,
    since they do not know what our tiles are. We only add wins in the pass case if
    we are guaranteed to win with any given tile, even given any mistakes the 
    opponent might make.

Options:
    -endgameplies 4

    Endgame plies defaults to 4. This is how far to look in the endgames. You may
    not need to look any farther than 2 plies if the spread difference is big
    (since you will likely only lose or win with an out bingo). On the other
    hand, you may want to look deeper if there's a Q or similar tile to draw,
    that may result in one player getting stuck with it.

    -threads 8

    Threads defaults to the number of cores in your machine. This is how many
    cores to use for the pre-endgame.

    -maxtime 10

    How much time to use. If we run out of time it will just return the best plays
    found so far. Unlimited by default.

    -early-cutoff true

    Macondo can stop analyzing a certain pre-endgame line if it finds that it will
    surely perform worse than the best line found so far. This speeds up analysis
    a lot of the time, at the cost of only the winning play being assured to have
    accurate results. If you turn this on, plays that were cut-off early will
    be marked with a ‚ùå symbol, and their stats may not be fully accurate.
