commit - commit a play in the given game, and move to the next turn

Example usage:

    commit #4
    commit 3J FOO
    commit K5 BAR.D
    commit exchange ABC
    commit pass

If you pass in a number, it refers to the number of the play
in the list of plays. You can see the current list of plays with the list
command, and you can generate plays to add to the list with the gen
command.

You can also commit a play that you would have otherwise added with the `add`
command, using the same parameters as `add`. See the help for the `add` command.
