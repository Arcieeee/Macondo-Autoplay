addcommit [params] - Add and commit a play at the same time.

Example:
   addcommit 3J FOO
   addcommit K5 BAR.D
   addcommit exchange ABC
   addcommit pass

Whereas `add` adds a play to the list of plays, and `commit` requires
a list to be generated and takes in a numerical argument, `addcommit`
is like `add` followed by a `commit`.

See the help text for `add` and `commit`.
