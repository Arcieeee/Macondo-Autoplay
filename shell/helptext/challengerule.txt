set challenge <rule> - Set the challenge rule

Example:

    set challenge void
    set challenge 5pt

This command sets the challenge rule. The options are:

void - Every play is validated before `commit` is accepted
5pt - Challenged player gets 5 pts if their play is valid.
10pt - Challenged player gets 10 pts if their play is valid.
double - Challenger loses their turn if the challenged play is valid.
single - There is no loss of turn if the challenged play is valid.

In the bottom 4 cases, if the challenged play is invalid, the player who
made the play always loses their turn. In void, it is impossible to make
an invalid play.
