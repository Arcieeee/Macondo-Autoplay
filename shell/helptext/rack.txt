rack <rack> - Set the player on turn's rack to the given rack.

Usage:
    
    rack FOO
    rack BAR?BAZ

This command checks whether the rack is actually possible to add, given
the unseen pool, and will fail if the rack is illegal.

If this is called in the middle of a game, every turn afterwards will
be deleted.
