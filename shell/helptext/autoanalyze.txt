autoanalyze <filepath> - Analyze a log file created by the `autoplay` command

Usage:
    autoanalyze /tmp/games-autoplay.txt

This command prints out some basic stats about the games in the given file.

Note: The `autoplay` command creates two log files; you specify the
path for the in-depth file which has turn-by-turn data. The other created
file has general data about who won each game. It is this latter file
that the `autoanalyze` command works on.

For example, if you specify a log file of /tmp/auto.txt, the file that
you should analyze is called /tmp/games-auto.txt.
